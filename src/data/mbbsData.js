    description: [
     "Pursuing an MBBS degree abroad has become a viable option for Indian students due to intense competition and limited seats in India. Countries like Russia, Nepal, Serbia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan offer quality medical education with modern facilities at more affordable costs.",
     "For instance, studying MBBS in India can cost between ₹50 lakh to ₹1.5 crore, whereas in countries like Russia and Kazakhstan, tuition fees range from ₹15 lakh to ₹30 lakh for the entire course.",
     "In 2024, over 24 lakh candidates registered for NEET UG, competing for approximately 1.18 lakh seats across 700 medical colleges in India, highlighting the intense competition. International medical universities not only provide quality education but also ensure comfortable and safe living conditions, along with valuable international exposure. Prospective students should research and choose institutions recognized by the National Medical Commission (NMC) to ensure their degrees are valid in India."
